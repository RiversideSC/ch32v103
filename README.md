EN | [中文](README_zh.md)



### Overview
The CH32V103 is a general purpose microcontroller based on the 32-bit RISC processor RISC-V3A. The CH32V103 provides clock security system, multi-level power management and general DMA controller. The CH32V103 is also equipped with abundant peripheral resources, such as single USB2.0 host/device interface, multi-channel 12-bit ADC module, multi-channel TouchKey, multiple timers, and multi-channel IIC/USART/SPI interfaces, etc.
